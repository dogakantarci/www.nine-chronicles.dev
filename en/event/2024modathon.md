# **Modathon Overview**

[Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/introduction) is a decentralized idle RPG built on blockchain technology.  
Over time, the community has created many exciting mods, and now, we want to see even more contributions. To support this, we're launching the **Nine Chronicles Modathon** with a prize pool of **225,000 NCG**.

We’ve developed new tools to make modding easier, and even **non-developers** can participate with our beginner-friendly tutorials. Join us in shaping the future of Nine Chronicles and bring your ideas to life! 🎮✨

# **Purpose of the Modathon**

The primary goal of the Nine Chronicles Modathon is to **strengthen** the Nine Chronicles modding ecosystem and **grow the number of community developers**. We hope that the projects created during the Modathon will **continue to evolve** and be used long after the event ends. 🚀

Additionally, since all Nine Chronicles-related products are open-source, we encourage participants to **contribute to them**, fostering a collaborative and ongoing development process.

# **Modathon Detail**

### **Introduction to the Modathon**

The Modathon is **a type of hackathon** where participants compete by creating mods.  
**Aim for first place by making a mod that players will love!** 🏆

Participants can create **any type of mod related to Nine Chronicles**, whether it’s a website, client modification, or any other kind of mod.  
**Promote your mod** during the event to earn positive feedback from the community. 📣

**Seven days before the event concludes**, we’ll hold a **community vote** to see which mod is most popular among users. The results will serve as a reference for the judging process, with internal rankings determining the final rewards.

There are **no genre restrictions** for mods—whether it's a website or a client modification, everything is welcome. And if you're not a developer but want to participate and **learn to develop** as you go, be sure to check out our [Non Developer Guide](./for-non-developer.md) for help. 💡

### **How to Participate**

The Nine Chronicles Modathon will primarily take place on the **[Planetarium Dev Discord](https://bit.ly/3Bf9oer)** server.  
However, participants will have `#mod-showcase` on the main **Planetarium Discord** server to promote their mods, and you can also list your mod in the GitHub repository at [awesome-9c](https://github.com/planetarium/awesome-9c).

For event-related questions, a Q&A channel will be available `#2024modathon` on the **Planetarium Dev** server, and feedback on mods can be shared through the `#introduce-mods` channel. You’re also welcome to use your own Discord or website if you prefer.

💡 **Have a mod idea?** Feel free to post it in the `#mod-ideas` channel on the **Planetarium Dev or Planetarium** server, where you can also find developers to collaborate with!

# **Submission Guidelines**
🛠️ **Submit your mod** through the **BUIDLs section** on [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/planetarium-2024modathon/detail), and make sure to include the link to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). The repository’s `README.md` **must contain a clear description of your mod**.

To ensure we have the necessary information for distributing rewards, please **click the "Register as Hacker" button** and fill out the required details in the linked Google Form.

You can join the event **at any time during the competition period**, even if your mod isn’t fully completed. Simply submit it with a description. However, at the event's conclusion, we will assess the submission to determine **whether it qualifies for participation** based on its completeness, to **prevent abuse**.

- Projects created **before September 2024** are not eligible unless they include **significant new features** added after this date.
- Teams may work on one project together, but **only the individual who submits the project** will receive the rewards.
- **All submissions** must be **open-source** and use an appropriate license, such as **GPL or AGPL**.
- Registrations can be submitted at any time until the end of the competition, but we **encourage early registration** before **October 1** to help ensure a smooth event process.
- If your mod **violates any copyright regulations**, it may be disqualified from the evaluation process.
