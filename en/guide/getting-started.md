# **Getting Started**

Welcome, developers! ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your interest in Nine Chronicles.

## **About Nine Chronicles**

[Nine Chronicles](https://docs.nine-chronicles.com/introduction) is an open-source online RPG that operates on a decentralized game network run by its players.  
Built using the blockchain library [Libplanet][libplanet], we developed Nine Chronicles' network protocol [Lib9c][lib9c], which can be easily accessed via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) through our [NineChronicles.Headless][nc-headless] implementation.  

For a seamless gaming experience, we offer a [game client][nc-unity] developed in [Unity][unity] and a [launcher][nc-launcher] that manages updates, game execution, and blockchain network connections.

## **Open Source**

To build and engage with the community, **all Nine Chronicles repositories are open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/planetarium)**.  
In addition to game backend and client code, you can also find server configurations for running the game on [9c-infra](https://github.com/planetarium/9c-infra) along with [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) for deployment.

Our developer portal is also open-source, and contributions are always welcome! Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/planetarium/www.nine-chronicles.dev). ðŸŒŸ

## **Developer Portal**

This portal provides guides and tutorials tailored to three types of developers: modders, network contributors, and open-source contributors. Whether youâ€™re interested in modding, understanding the network, or contributing to open-source projects, weâ€™ve got you covered!

### **Modders**

Modding for Nine Chronicles can include creating websites related to the game, client modifications, or even rebuilding the client itself. For more inspiration, check out the various mods on [awesome-9c](https://github.com/planetarium/awesome-9c).

- If you're interested in modding, explore our [Modding Guide](./modding/getting-started.md) for detailed tutorials.

### **Network**

If you're interested in participating in the Nine Chronicles network or modifying the network protocol to create your own version of the game, weâ€™ve prepared **several resources** for you.  
You can find tutorials on running the network locally and guides that explain the structure of the network.

- To learn more about the Nine Chronicles network, check out the [Network Guide](./network/getting-started).

### **Open Source Contributions**

Nine Chronicles is powered by over 10 different repositories that interact with each other to keep everything running smoothly.  
With so many repositories, it may seem complex, but weâ€™ve created a guide that explains the overall structure and the role each repository plays, so you can start contributing with confidence.
